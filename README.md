Welcome to my first ASP.NET Core web app! It's a type of project management app, but it's not really very useful, or pretty. It wasn't really meant to be - it's just a learning experience. I've purposefully sought out the hard ways of doing things to help me go off the beaten track and understand C# and ASP.NET Core better, for instance using AWS DynamoDB noSQL DBs rather than MS SQL etc, and building my own user store and custom UI for ASP .NET Identity.
