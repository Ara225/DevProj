Welcome to my first ASP.NET Core web app! 
It's a type of project management app, but it's not really very useful, or pretty. It wasn't really meant to be - it's just a tool I've used to deep dive into C# and ASP .NET Core so the actual core function of the app Isn't particually key. 

I've purposefully sought out the hard ways of doing things to help me go off the beaten track and understand C# and ASP.NET Core better, for instance using AWS DynamoDB (a NoSQL database) rather than MS SQL, and building my own user store and custom UI for ASP .NET Core Identity. Aside from this however, I've tried to use best practices whereever possible and build as close to real world as possible, for instance by putting secrets in AWS parameter store and setting up a real email sender with AWS SES.
